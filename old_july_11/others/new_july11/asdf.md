try again but format the instructios nin the most physically lean and concise way you can imagine

Edit
REPLACE IN: path/to/file.md
FIND:
lalala
123
WITH:
hohoho
456
yaa



but what if the "FIND" string contains a line that is just "WITH:"?  how would oyu change this format then

Good point! Here's a more robust format:

```
FILE: path/to/file.md
FIND>>>
lalala
 123
<<<FIND
REPLACE>>>
hohoho
 456
yaa
<<<REPLACE
```

Or even simpler with unique delimiters:

```
path/to/file.md
===FIND===
lalala
 123
===REPLACE===
hohoho
 456
yaa
===END===
```

You're right - they're too terse without context. Here's a clearer version:

```
TASK: Replace text in file

FILE PATH: path/to/file.md
ACTION: Find and replace all occurrences

===SEARCH FOR THIS EXACT TEXT===
lalala
 123
===REPLACE WITH THIS EXACT TEXT===
hohoho
 456
yaa
===END OF REPLACEMENT===
```

Or even more explicit:

```
STRING REPLACEMENT TASK
Replace all occurrences of a multi-line string in the specified file.

Target file: path/to/file.md

Find this exact text (including spaces and line breaks):
<<<SEARCH_START>>>
lalala
 123
<<<SEARCH_END>>>

Replace with this exact text:
<<<REPLACE_START>>>
hohoho
 456
yaa
<<<REPLACE_END>>>
```

The second version leaves no ambiguity about what action to perform.

Yes! Use a generated unique ID as part of the delimiter. Here's how:

```
STRING REPLACEMENT TASK
Target file: path/to/file.md
Delimiter ID: 7f8a9b2c

<<<SEARCH_7f8a9b2c>>>
lalala
 123
<<<END_SEARCH_7f8a9b2c>>>

<<<REPLACE_7f8a9b2c>>>
hohoho
 456
yaa
<<<END_REPLACE_7f8a9b2c>>>
```

Or with a more compact format:

```
REPLACE_TASK
FILE: path/to/file.md
DELIM: @4x9kp3m@

@4x9kp3m@FIND@4x9kp3m@
lalala
 123
@4x9kp3m@WITH@4x9kp3m@
hohoho
 456
yaa
@4x9kp3m@END@4x9kp3m@
```

The random ID (like `7f8a9b2c` or `4x9kp3m`) makes it virtually impossible for the delimiter to accidentally appear in the content. The parser looks for the exact delimiter pattern including the ID.

Here's a syntax that's both parser-friendly and LLM-friendly:

```
REPLACE_TASK
FILE: path/to/file.md
DELIMITER: <<UNIQUE_ID>>

<<UNIQUE_ID>>SEARCH_START<<UNIQUE_ID>>
lalala
 123
<<UNIQUE_ID>>SEARCH_END<<UNIQUE_ID>>

<<UNIQUE_ID>>REPLACE_START<<UNIQUE_ID>>
hohoho
 456
yaa
<<UNIQUE_ID>>REPLACE_END<<UNIQUE_ID>>
```

**Instructions for LLMs to generate this format:**

> Generate a file replacement task using this exact format:
> 1. Start with `REPLACE_TASK` on its own line
> 2. Next line: `FILE: ` followed by the file path
> 3. Next line: `DELIMITER: <<UNIQUE_ID>>`
> 4. Generate a random 8-character alphanumeric string to replace `UNIQUE_ID` throughout
> 5. Empty line
> 6. `<<UNIQUE_ID>>SEARCH_START<<UNIQUE_ID>>` (using your generated ID)
> 7. The exact text to search for (preserving all whitespace/newlines)
> 8. `<<UNIQUE_ID>>SEARCH_END<<UNIQUE_ID>>`
> 9. Empty line
> 10. `<<UNIQUE_ID>>REPLACE_START<<UNIQUE_ID>>`
> 11. The exact text to replace with (preserving all whitespace/newlines)
> 12. `<<UNIQUE_ID>>REPLACE_END<<UNIQUE_ID>>`

This format is:
- Unambiguous for parsers (clear field markers and delimiters)
- Easy for LLMs to follow (step-by-step structure)
- Handles any content (unique delimiter prevents collisions)

Looking at my whitespace choices:

1. **No space after field names** (`FILE:` not `FILE: `) - This is inconsistent with my example which shows `FILE: path/to/file.md`. Should be one or the other.

2. **Blank line after DELIM** - This separates the "header/config" section from the "content" section, making it visually clear where the actual find/replace content begins.

3. **No blank lines between FIND/WITH/END sections** - Keeps the operation compact. Since the delimiters clearly mark boundaries, extra spacing isn't needed.

Here's a cleaner version with consistent spacing:

```
!EXEC:REPLACE
FILE:path/to/file.md
DELIM:#A7K9M2X3#

#A7K9M2X3#FIND#A7K9M2X3#
lalala
 123
#A7K9M2X3#WITH#A7K9M2X3#
hohoho
 456
yaa
#A7K9M2X3#END#A7K9M2X3#
```

Or with spaces after colons:

```
!EXEC:REPLACE
FILE: path/to/file.md
DELIM: #A7K9M2X3#

#A7K9M2X3#FIND#A7K9M2X3#
lalala
 123
#A7K9M2X3#WITH#A7K9M2X3#
hohoho
 456
yaa
#A7K9M2X3#END#A7K9M2X3#
```

The second feels more readable, but the first is more compact for parsing.

For a file text replacement operation, I'd instinctively use a syntax like this:

```
replace in "path/to/file.txt":
<<<SEARCH
text to find
possibly spanning
multiple lines
SEARCH
>>>REPLACE
replacement text
can also span
multiple lines
REPLACE
```

This syntax has several natural advantages:
- The command verb "replace in" clearly states the operation
- The file path is quoted to handle paths with spaces
- The heredoc-style delimiters (<<<SEARCH and >>>REPLACE) make it easy to specify multi-line content
- The matching end tags (SEARCH and REPLACE) help prevent errors
- The syntax is readable at a glance and resembles formats developers are likely familiar with

Would you like me to suggest any variations or alternatives to this format?

Looking at this problem, I'd instinctively use a simple block-based syntax with clear delimiters:

```
@replace file:path/to/file.txt
@search
original text here
can be multiple lines
@with
replacement text here
also multiple lines
@end
```

This feels natural because:
- `@replace file:` clearly indicates the operation and target
- `@search` and `@with` are intuitive keywords
- Multi-line content is handled cleanly without escaping
- `@end` provides a clear terminator
- The whole block reads like plain English

Alternative that's even simpler if you prefer:

```
replace in path/to/file.txt:
---
old text
spanning lines
---
new text
spanning lines
---
```

The `---` delimiters are familiar from markdown and make the three sections (command, search, replace) visually distinct.

I'll create an artifact that demonstrates a clear, unambiguous syntax for file replacement commands that addresses the key challenges you've outlined.

<artifact type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="markdown">
# File Replacement Command Syntax

```
REPLACE_IN_FILE
---
file: /path/to/target/file.txt
find: <original text to be replaced>
replace: <new text to replace the original>
---
```

## Key Design Principles:
1. Uses YAML-like delimiter blocks (`---`) to create clear separation
2. Explicit `file:` specifies the target file
3. `find:` and `replace:` clearly indicate the replacement operation
4. Allows for multi-line text with no escape character limitations
5. Self-documenting and human-readable format

## Example Usages:

### Simple Single-Line Replacement
```
REPLACE_IN_FILE
---
file: config.yaml
find: database_host: localhost
replace: database_host: production-db.example.com
---
```

### Multi-Line Complex Replacement
```
REPLACE_IN_FILE
---
file: README.md
find: ## Project Status

This project is no longer maintained.
Contributions are not accepted.
find>
replace: ## Project Status

This project is actively maintained.
We welcome community contributions!
---
```

### Replacement with Special Characters
```
REPLACE_IN_FILE
---
file: script.js
find: const regex = /[^a-z]/g;
replace: const regex = /[a-zA-Z0-9_]/g;
---
```

## Parser Parsing Guidelines:
- Identify commands starting with `REPLACE_IN_FILE`
- Use `---` to parse command block
- Extract `file`, `find`, and `replace` fields
- Perform text replacement preserving original file permissions
```
</artifact>

This syntax addresses the key challenges you mentioned:
1. Clear command identifier (`REPLACE_IN_FILE`)
2. Uses multi-line YAML-like delimiters to handle text with any characters
3. Provides a consistent, unambiguous format
4. Self-documenting and readable
5. Flexible for various replacement scenarios

The design allows for multi-line replacements, handles special characters easily, and makes the intent of the command immediately clear. The parser can easily parse this format by looking for the specific command start and using the `---` blocks to extract the necessary information.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this proposed syntax?

That's an excellent point! We need to handle the case where the text itself contains our delimiters, which is a classic problem in parsing.

After thinking about it, I believe a more robust approach would be to use a delimiter scheme that can be uniquely generated for each command instance. Here's what feels most natural to me:

```
REPLACE IN FILE "path/to/file.txt" {
  FIND <<<DELIMITER_12345>>>
  This is text to find which might contain anything, including:
  - "quotes"
  - {braces}
  - backslashes \
  - or even the words END_FIND or DELIMITER
  <<<DELIMITER_12345>>>

  REPLACE <<<DELIMITER_67890>>>
  This is replacement text which might also contain anything, including:
  - Our previous delimiters like END_FIND
  - Or even <<<DELIMITER_12345>>>
  <<<DELIMITER_67890>>>
}
```

The key improvements:

1. Each FIND and REPLACE section uses a unique delimiter token (e.g., `<<<DELIMITER_12345>>>`)
2. These delimiters include random numbers/strings to ensure they won't appear in the content
3. The delimiter is specified right after FIND or REPLACE, then repeated to close the section
4. The uniqueness of each delimiter makes it extremely unlikely to conflict with content

For multiple replacements, I would naturally write:

```
REPLACE IN FILE "path/to/file.txt" {
  FIND <<<DELIMITER_A1B2C3>>>
  First text to find
  <<<DELIMITER_A1B2C3>>>

  REPLACE <<<DELIMITER_D4E5F6>>>
  First replacement text
  <<<DELIMITER_D4E5F6>>>

  FIND <<<DELIMITER_G7H8I9>>>
  Second text to find
  <<<DELIMITER_G7H8I9>>>

  REPLACE <<<DELIMITER_J0K1L2>>>
  Second replacement text
  <<<DELIMITER_J0K1L2>>>
}
```

This approach creates unique delimiter boundaries for each section, making it virtually impossible for the content to accidentally contain the exact delimiter that was randomly generated for that specific command. The parser would read the delimiter after FIND or REPLACE, then look for that exact same delimiter to mark the end of the section.

# Natural File Replacement Command Syntax

## My Preferred Approach: Block-Based with Heredoc-Style Delimiters

```
REPLACE_IN_FILE: src/components/Button.jsx
FIND:
<<<FIND_END
const Button = ({ onClick, children }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
};
FIND_END

REPLACE_WITH:
<<<REPLACE_END
const Button = ({ onClick, children, disabled = false }) => {
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={onClick} 
      disabled={disabled}
      className={disabled ? 'btn-disabled' : 'btn-active'}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
REPLACE_END
```

## Why This Feels Natural to Me:

1. **Clear Command Structure**: `REPLACE_IN_FILE:` immediately signals this is an executable command
2. **Unambiguous Delimiters**: Using `<<<DELIMITER` and `DELIMITER` makes it virtually impossible to have conflicts
3. **Readable Flow**: The structure mirrors how I naturally think about the task
4. **Flexible Content**: Can handle any characters, including other delimiters, code blocks, etc.

## Alternative Approaches I'd Also Find Natural:

### Option 2: XML-Style with CDATA
```
<replace_in_file path="src/utils/helpers.js">
  <find><![CDATA[
function formatDate(date) {
  return date.toLocaleDateString();
}
  ]]></find>
  <replace_with><![CDATA[
function formatDate(date, locale = 'en-US') {
  return date.toLocaleDateString(locale, {
    year: 'numeric',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric'
  });
}
  ]]></replace_with>
</replace_in_file>
```

### Option 3: JSON-Style with Escaped Content
```
{
  "command": "replace_in_file",
  "file": "src/config/settings.json",
  "find": "{\n  \"apiUrl\": \"http://localhost:3000\"\n}",
  "replace_with": "{\n  \"apiUrl\": \"https://api.production.com\",\n  \"timeout\": 5000\n}"
}
```

## What Makes These Feel Natural:

- **Command Intent is Clear**: No ambiguity about whether this is executable
- **Content Protection**: The delimiters protect against any possible content conflicts
- **Structured but Readable**: Easy for both humans and parsers to understand
- **Consistent Pattern**: Once you learn the format, it's predictable

The heredoc-style approach feels most natural because it's how I'd naturally want to separate the "meta" information (what file, what action) from the "content" information (the actual text to find/replace).

Yes, that's much clearer! Let me think about what would feel natural for me to write as commands to a parser...

When I need to communicate file replacement commands clearly, here's what feels most natural:

```
REPLACE IN FILE: src/main.py
FIND:
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item.price
    return total
END_FIND

WITH:
def calculate_total(items):
    """Calculate the total price of all items."""
    if not items:
        return 0
    return sum(item.price for item in items)
END_WITH
```

Or for a more compact but still unambiguous format:

```
FILE: config/settings.json
<<<ORIGINAL
{
  "debug": true,
  "port": 3000,
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost"
  }
}
>>>
<<<REPLACEMENT
{
  "debug": false,
  "port": 8080,
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "pool_size": 10
  }
}
>>>
```

The key elements that feel natural to me:
1. Clear indication this is a command (REPLACE IN FILE, FILE:)
2. Distinctive markers that are unlikely to appear in code (<<<, >>>, END_FIND, END_WITH)
3. Semantic labels (ORIGINAL/REPLACEMENT or FIND/WITH) 
4. Multi-line block structure for clarity

Would either of these approaches work well for your parser?

You need to write commands that a parser will read and execute. Specifically, you need to tell the parser to replace text in files.
The challenges:
- The parser needs to know this is a command to execute (not just example code)
- The text to find/replace might contain ANY characters, including whatever delimiters you use
- The parser needs a consistent, unambiguous format
Show me what syntax feels most natural for you to write these file replacement commands.----------check out some of these responses from other chats for brainstorming assistanceEditLooking at the challenge of creating unambiguous file replacement commands, I'd naturally write something like this:
!REPLACE path/to/file.js
!FIND_BLOCK_7a3f9k2m
const oldFunction = () => {
  console.log("This needs updating");
  return false;
};
!END_BLOCK_7a3f9k2m
!WITH_BLOCK_7a3f9k2m
const newFunction = () => {
  console.log("Updated version");
  return true;
};
!END_BLOCK_7a3f9k2m
The key aspects that feel natural to me:

Command prefix ! - Makes it unmistakably a command, not example code
Random suffix on delimiters - Prevents collision with actual content
Clear verbs - REPLACE, FIND_BLOCK, WITH_BLOCK are self-documenting
Matching end markers - END_BLOCK with same ID ensures proper pairing

For simpler cases, I might write:
!REPLACE src/config.yaml
!DELIMITER:##X4mK9##
##X4mK9##FIND##X4mK9##
host: localhost
port: 3000
##X4mK9##WITH##X4mK9##
host: production.example.com
port: 443
##X4mK9##END##X4mK9##
This feels more compact while still being unambiguous - the parser can extract the delimiter pattern and use it to parse the content sections safely.RetrySCthe most important aspect is acutally a format that can be reliably written by LLMs.EditAh, that's a crucial insight! For LLM reliability, I'd design something much more structured and repetitive:
===BEGIN_REPLACE_COMMAND===
TARGET_FILE: path/to/file.js
UNIQUE_BOUNDARY: @@BOUNDARY_8f3a2b1c@@

@@BOUNDARY_8f3a2b1c@@BEGIN_SEARCH_TEXT@@BOUNDARY_8f3a2b1c@@

  console.log("This needs updating");

  console.log("Updated version");
  return true;
};
@@BOUNDARY_8f3a2b1c@@END_REPLACEMENT_TEXT@@BOUNDARY_8f3a2b1c@@
===END_REPLACE_COMMAND===
Why this works well for LLMs:

Explicit boundaries everywhere - LLMs are less likely to forget closing tags when they're this prominent
Redundant markers - The boundary appears multiple times, reducing errors
Clear sections - Each part has BEGIN/END pairs that are hard to mess up
Single boundary definition - LLM only needs to generate one random ID and reuse it
Verbose keywords - BEGIN_SEARCH_TEXT is harder to confuse than just FIND

The format trades conciseness for reliability - exactly what you want when LLMs are generating it.RetrySCthink about this more in detail. wdyt?  do 3 rounds of this complete process: [thoroughly re-read your previous answers as a startingn point, then scour the docs for relevant backgorund info, then do critical analysis, then self reflection]  and then at the end, list out all the unresolved uncertainties, make executive deicions for them, and then reflect on those to share final decisions and any remaining uncertainties.  summarize your final thoughts and summary at the end.  check online as you go as neededEditI'll work through this systematically to design the most LLM-friendly file replacement command format.

From my research, several key insights emerge:

Delimiter collision is a fundamental problem - As shown in the Wikipedia article and various sources, delimiter collision occurs when content contains the delimiter characters themselves. This is especially problematic for file replacement commands where the content could be arbitrary code.
LLMs struggle with structured output - Multiple sources (Instill AI, Leeway Hertz) indicate that LLMs perform worse when forced to generate strictly formatted output. The more rigid the format requirements, the more their reasoning capabilities degrade.
Escape sequences create complexity - While escape sequences can solve delimiter collision, they introduce "leaning toothpick syndrome" and make content harder to read and generate correctly.
Random/unique delimiters are most robust - The consensus across sources is that using randomly generated, unique delimiters (like in heredoc syntax) is the most reliable approach to avoid collision.
Two-stage approach works better - The Instill AI research shows that separating reasoning from formatting into two distinct steps produces more reliable results.

Self Reflection
My initial suggestions in the previous responses were on the right track but could be improved:

I correctly identified the need for unique delimiters
However, I may have made the format too verbose in some cases
The balance between clarity and reliability needs careful consideration
LLMs need repetitive, predictable patterns more than humans do

From this additional research:

Heredoc syntax is widely understood - Multiple sources show heredoc is a common pattern across many languages (Bash, PHP, Ruby, etc.) that programmers recognize for handling multi-line content without delimiter collision issues.
LLMs struggle with code maintenance - The nullprogram article emphasizes that while LLMs can generate code, they don't consider maintainability or produce production-quality code beyond simple snippets.
Context management is crucial - Simon Willison's article highlights that managing the LLM's context window is the most important factor in getting good results.
Clear, repetitive patterns work best - Multiple sources emphasize that LLMs perform better with clear, consistent patterns rather than clever or terse syntax.
Testing and validation are essential - The PromptHub research shows that different LLMs make different types of errors, emphasizing the need for robust validation.

Self Reflection
The heredoc approach seems to be converging as the optimal solution because:

It's a well-established pattern programmers already understand
It naturally handles the delimiter collision problem
It's visually clear and separates metadata from content
LLMs are likely to have seen many examples in training data

From the parser implementation research:

Simple is better for command parsing - Multiple sources emphasize that command-line parsing doesn't need complex parser algorithms (LL/LR). A simple tokenizer with some logic is sufficient.
Tokenization is the first step - All approaches start by breaking the input into tokens, then processing those tokens according to rules.
Error handling is crucial - Good parsers provide clear error messages when syntax is incorrect, which helps both humans and LLMs understand what went wrong.
Flexibility vs strictness tradeoff - More flexible parsers are harder to validate but easier to use; stricter parsers catch more errors but require more precise input.

Self Reflection
For LLM-generated commands, we need:

Clear, unambiguous syntax that's hard to mess up
Good error messages when things go wrong
A format that's visually distinct from regular text
Patterns that LLMs have seen before in training

Unresolved Uncertainties and Executive Decisions
Uncertainties Identified:

Delimiter format: Should we use heredoc-style (<<<DELIMITER), XML-style tags, or custom markers?
Unique ID generation: Should the LLM generate random IDs or should we use fixed delimiters?
Verbosity vs conciseness: How much structure is too much?
Multiple replacements: Should we support multiple find/replace operations in one command?
Error recovery: How should the parser handle malformed commands?

Executive Decisions:

Use heredoc-style syntax - It's widely recognized, appears in training data, and naturally handles delimiter collision
Fixed delimiter with unique suffix - Use <<<REPLACE_BLOCK_[8-char-id]>>> format for clarity and uniqueness
Explicit section markers - Use FIND_BLOCK and REPLACE_BLOCK for absolute clarity
Single replacement per command - Simpler for LLMs to generate correctly
Fail fast with clear errors - Better to reject malformed commands than guess intent

Final Design:
!REPLACE_FILE path/to/file.js
!DELIMITER: <<<BLOCK_7a9f2k3m>>>
<<<BLOCK_7a9f2k3m>>>FIND_START<<<BLOCK_7a9f2k3m>>>
original content
that needs replacing
<<<BLOCK_7a9f2k3m>>>FIND_END<<<BLOCK_7a9f2k3m>>>
<<<BLOCK_7a9f2k3m>>>REPLACE_START<<<BLOCK_7a9f2k3m>>>
new content
to replace with
<<<BLOCK_7a9f2k3m>>>REPLACE_END<<<BLOCK_7a9f2k3m>>>
!END_COMMAND
Summary and Final Thoughts
After thorough analysis, the optimal format for LLM-generated file replacement commands should:

Use explicit command markers (!REPLACE_FILE, !END_COMMAND) to clearly distinguish commands from content
Declare the delimiter upfront (!DELIMITER:) so the parser knows what to look for
Use heredoc-style boundaries with unique IDs to prevent collision
Have redundant markers (START/END pairs) to help LLMs maintain structure
Be visually distinct with special characters (!, <<<, >>>) that stand out

This format balances:

Reliability: LLMs are less likely to make mistakes with clear, repetitive patterns
Parsability: Simple tokenization can handle this format
Collision resistance: Unique delimiters prevent content interference
Clarity: Human readable and debuggable

The key insight is that LLMs need more structure and redundancy than humans would prefer, but this extra verbosity dramatically improves reliability. The format may seem overly explicit, but research shows this actually helps LLMs generate correct output more consistently.
Remaining uncertainties:

Whether 8 characters is sufficient for the unique ID (could be increased if needed)
Whether the parser should support variations in whitespace/formatting
How to handle edge cases like empty find/replace blocks

These can be resolved through implementation testing and user feedback.RetrySCcan we make it less verbose but just as clear and reliable for LLMs?EditYes! After analyzing the key requirements, here's a more concise format that maintains clarity and reliability:
!REPLACE path/to/file.js
!BEGIN_FIND
original content
that needs replacing
!END_FIND
!BEGIN_REPLACE
new content
to replace with
!END_REPLACE
Key improvements:

Removed redundant delimiter declaration - The !BEGIN_FIND and !END_FIND markers are already unique enough
Dropped the random ID - Using !BEGIN_ and !END_ prefixes makes accidental collision extremely unlikely
Eliminated the closing !END_COMMAND - The !END_REPLACE naturally terminates the command
Shortened command name - !REPLACE instead of !REPLACE_FILE

This format is still reliable because:

The ! prefix clearly marks command lines vs content
BEGIN/END pairs are a well-established pattern in programming
The explicit section names (FIND/REPLACE) prevent confusion
It's visually distinct and easy to parse

If we're still concerned about delimiter collision, we could use a slightly more unique pattern:
!REPLACE path/to/file.js
!>>FIND
original content
that needs replacing
!<<FIND
!>>REPLACE  
new content
to replace with
!<<REPLACE
This uses !>> to open and !<< to close sections, which is even less likely to appear in real code while remaining concise.
Both formats are about 40% less verbose than my original proposal while maintaining the essential properties that make them LLM-friendly: clear boundaries, consistent patterns, and unambiguous structure.RetrySCno we still need some sort of unique id or custom heredoc.  because at some point we will need to be referenceing the same syntax style we're writing inEditYou're absolutely right! If we're writing commands to modify files that might contain our own command syntax, we definitely need unique delimiters. Here's a more concise version that still handles delimiter collision:
!REPLACE path/to/file.js #7a9f2k3m#
#7a9f2k3m#FIND#7a9f2k3m#
original content
that needs replacing
#7a9f2k3m#END_FIND#7a9f2k3m#
#7a9f2k3m#REPLACE#7a9f2k3m#
new content
to replace with
#7a9f2k3m#END_REPLACE#7a9f2k3m#
Or even more concise with a heredoc-inspired approach:
!REPLACE path/to/file.js <<<ID_7a9f2k3m>>>
<<<ID_7a9f2k3m>>>
original content
that needs replacing
<<<ID_7a9f2k3m>>>
new content
to replace with
<<<ID_7a9f2k3m>>>
The second format uses position to determine sections (first block is FIND, second is REPLACE), which cuts verbosity significantly.
If we want to be explicit about sections while staying concise:
!REPLACE path/to/file.js
!FIND <<<EOT_7a9f2k3m>>>
original content
that needs replacing
<<<EOT_7a9f2k3m>>>
!WITH <<<EOT_7a9f2k3m>>>
new content
to replace with
<<<EOT_7a9f2k3m>>>
This last format feels most natural to me - it's heredoc-style (which LLMs know well), explicitly labels sections, but avoids redundant BEGIN/END pairs. The unique ID prevents any collision, even when modifying files containing this exact command syntax.RetrySCwould itbe better to use more explicit heredoc style notation?  or could that end up actually confusing the LLMEditYou raise a great point about LLM confusion. Let me think about what LLMs have seen most in training data...
Traditional heredoc syntax varies by language:

Bash: <<EOF ... EOF
PHP: <<<EOT ... EOT
Ruby: <<-DELIMITER ... DELIMITER

The concern is that LLMs might get confused and try to follow language-specific heredoc rules (like indentation handling, variable interpolation, etc.) rather than treating it as a simple delimiter.
I think the clearest approach is to use a syntax that's heredoc-inspired but distinct enough to not trigger language-specific patterns:
!REPLACE path/to/file.js
!FIND_START:7a9f2k3m
original content
that needs replacing
!FIND_END:7a9f2k3m
!REPLACE_START:7a9f2k3m
new content
to replace with
!REPLACE_END:7a9f2k3m
This is explicit and unambiguous because:

It doesn't look like any specific language's heredoc
The ! prefix and :ID suffix create a unique pattern
START/END pairs are crystal clear
The ID prevents collision

Alternatively, if we want something more compact but still explicit:
!REPLACE path/to/file.js
@7a9f2k3m@FIND@
original content
that needs replacing
@7a9f2k3m@WITH@
new content  
to replace with
@7a9f2k3m@END@
This uses @ID@SECTION@ markers which are unlikely to appear in code and don't resemble any particular language's syntax, reducing the chance of LLM confusion while staying concise.
