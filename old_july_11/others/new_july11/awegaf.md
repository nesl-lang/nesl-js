y synthesis would be:
REPLACE path/to/file.js
DELIM: <<<7a9f2k3m>>>
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>FIND
original content
that needs replacing
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>WITH
new content
to replace with
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>END
This format:

Uses a heredoc-inspired pattern that LLMs recognize
Requires only one unique ID generation
Has clear section markers (FIND/WITH/END)
Avoids redundant BEGIN/END pairs
Is visually distinct with <<<>>>

The beauty is that it's concise enough for practical use while still being explicit enough for reliable LLM generation. The parser implementation would be straightforward - extract the delimiter from the DELIM line, then use it to parse the sections.
What do you think about this synthesis? Does it capture the right balance between the competing needs?SCwdyt about using this nomenclature with such a command? in any syntaxEdit
  file_path 
  old_string
  new_stringI really like the Edit nomenclature! It's concise, action-oriented, and immediately clear. The three-parameter structure (file_path, old_string, new_string) is beautifully simple.
Here's how it could look with the delimiter syntax we've been discussing:
Edit path/to/file.js
DELIM: <<<7a9f2k3m>>>
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>OLD
original content
that needs replacing
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>NEW
new content
to replace with
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>END
Or even simpler:
Edit path/to/file.js <<<7a9f2k3m>>>
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>
original content
that needs replacing
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>
new content
to replace with
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>
The "Edit" command name has several advantages:

It's a common, intuitive verb that clearly indicates modification
It's shorter than "REPLACE" or "REPLACE_IN_FILE"
It aligns with familiar terminology (text editors, edit commands)
The old_string/new_string nomenclature is self-explanatory

The second format above uses positional parameters (first block = old_string, second = new_string) which makes it extremely concise while still handling delimiter collision through the unique ID.
This feels like the right level of abstraction - simple enough to write quickly, clear enough to parse reliably.SCedit's not too vaggue?You're right to question it - "Edit" is quite vague. When I think about it more carefully:

"Edit" could mean: append, insert, delete, replace, modify formatting, etc.
It doesn't specify the operation clearly
A parser would need additional context to know what to do

More precise alternatives that maintain clarity:
Replace path/to/file.js <<<7a9f2k3m>>>
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>
original content
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>
new content
<<<7a9f2k3m>>>
