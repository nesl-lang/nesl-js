I'll search for real-world MCP (Model Context Protocol) API payload examples that would typically be generated by LLMs.

Based on my search, here are real-world MCP API payload examples that would be written by LLMs:

## 1. Tool Invocation Request
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "fetch_github_issues",
    "arguments": {
      "repo": "anthropic/claude-desktop",
      "state": "open",
      "labels": ["bug", "high-priority"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Create GitHub Issue
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 456,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "github_create_issue",
    "arguments": {
      "title": "Fix authentication flow in OAuth handler",
      "body": "The current OAuth implementation fails when refresh tokens expire. Need to implement proper token renewal logic.",
      "labels": ["bug", "authentication"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Database Query
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 789,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "execute_query",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE created_at > '2025-01-01' AND status = 'pending'",
      "database": "production"
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. File System Operations
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 234,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "write_file",
    "arguments": {
      "filepath": "/workspace/analysis/report.md",
      "content": "# Sales Analysis Q1 2025\n\n## Key Findings\n- Revenue increased 23% YoY\n- Customer acquisition cost decreased by 15%"
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. Complex Data Analysis
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 567,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "analyze_csv",
    "arguments": {
      "filepath": "/data/sales_2025.csv",
      "operations": ["sum", "average", "count"],
      "groupBy": "region",
      "columns": ["revenue", "units_sold"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Multi-step Workflow
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 890,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "search_tiktoken_documentation",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "BPE tokenization algorithm implementation",
      "max_results": 5
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Characteristics

These payloads follow JSON-RPC 2.0 format with required fields: "jsonrpc": "2.0", unique "id", "method", and optional "params". The LLM generates:

1. **Contextually appropriate tool names** - matching available MCP server capabilities
2. **Structured arguments** - following the tool's input schema
3. **Dynamic parameter values** - based on user intent and conversation context
4. **Complex nested structures** - for tools requiring arrays, objects, or multi-level parameters

The payloads demonstrate how LLMs translate natural language requests into structured API calls, handling everything from simple calculations to complex multi-parameter operations across different domains (GitHub, databases, file systems, data analysis).

Yes, several scenarios require deeply nested objects in MCP payloads:

## 1. Complex Query Builders
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "execute_analytics_query",
    "arguments": {
      "query": {
        "aggregations": {
          "by_region": {
            "terms": {
              "field": "region",
              "size": 10
            },
            "aggregations": {
              "by_product": {
                "terms": {
                  "field": "product_category"
                },
                "aggregations": {
                  "revenue_stats": {
                    "extended_stats": {
                      "field": "revenue"
                    }
                  },
                  "by_month": {
                    "date_histogram": {
                      "field": "order_date",
                      "interval": "month"
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Workflow Automation with Conditional Logic
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 456,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "create_workflow",
    "arguments": {
      "workflow": {
        "triggers": {
          "on_pr_created": {
            "conditions": {
              "all": [
                {
                  "any": [
                    {
                      "field": "files_changed",
                      "operator": "contains",
                      "value": "src/"
                    },
                    {
                      "field": "labels",
                      "operator": "includes",
                      "value": "needs-review"
                    }
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "field": "author.permissions",
                  "operator": "not_includes",
                  "value": "admin"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        },
        "actions": {
          "assign_reviewers": {
            "config": {
              "strategy": {
                "round_robin": {
                  "pool": ["user1", "user2"],
                  "exclude_conditions": {
                    "user_status": {
                      "operator": "equals",
                      "value": "on_vacation"
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Infrastructure as Code Deployments
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 789,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "deploy_infrastructure",
    "arguments": {
      "resources": {
        "compute": {
          "web_servers": {
            "scaling": {
              "auto_scaling_group": {
                "min_size": 2,
                "max_size": 10,
                "policies": {
                  "scale_up": {
                    "metrics": {
                      "cpu_utilization": {
                        "threshold": 80,
                        "duration": 300,
                        "statistics": {
                          "type": "average",
                          "period": 60
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Why These Patterns Emerge

1. **Domain modeling** - Real-world systems have inherently hierarchical relationships (region→product→time→metrics)

2. **Configuration complexity** - Enterprise tools require nested conditions, rules, and policies that mirror organizational structures

3. **API compatibility** - Many MCP servers wrap existing APIs (Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, GraphQL) that already use deep nesting

4. **Logical composition** - Complex boolean logic naturally creates depth (AND of ORs, nested conditions)

5. **Resource relationships** - Infrastructure definitions inherently model parent-child-grandchild relationships

The 3-level limit would break legitimate use cases in analytics, automation, and infrastructure management where the problem domain itself is hierarchical.

> and these are things that an LLM would need to be able to write, right?  am i understanding MCP correctly?


Yes, you understand correctly. The LLM must generate these complex nested structures because:

1. **MCP's core design** - The LLM acts as the "brain" that translates user intent into tool calls. The MCP server just exposes capabilities; the LLM decides when/how to invoke them.

2. **No intermediate layer** - There's typically no simplification layer between the LLM and the MCP server. If the underlying API (Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, etc.) requires deep nesting, the LLM must produce it.

3. **Real-world evidence** - MCP clients are AI applications or agents that want to access external systems, tools, or data sources. The examples from production MCP servers (GitHub, analytics tools) show they expose their native complexity directly.

4. **Dynamic composition** - The LLM can't rely on pre-built templates because it must dynamically construct payloads based on:
   - User's natural language request
   - Available tool schemas
   - Conversation context
   - Previous results

**

> and LLM would need to read payload response from MCP too right?


Yes. The LLM must parse and understand MCP response payloads to:

1. **Extract results for users** - Transform raw JSON responses into natural language answers

2. **Handle errors intelligently** - Parse error structures to determine retry logic or alternative approaches:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 123,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Invalid parameters",
    "data": {
      "details": "Column 'revenue' not found in dataset",
      "available_columns": ["sales", "profit", "units"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Chain operations** - Use output from one tool as input to another:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 456,
  "result": {
    "query_id": "q-789abc",
    "status": "processing",
    "estimated_time": 30
  }
}
```
The LLM must understand it needs to poll or wait before retrieving results.

4. **Handle complex return structures** - Analytics tools return nested aggregations, GitHub returns paginated results with metadata, databases return result sets with schemas.

After approval, the runtime executes the call, streams back the result, and the model decides whether to chain another tool or return a final answer

Critical implication: The LLM must maintain semantic understanding across both request generation AND response interpretation, handling arbitrarily complex JSON structures in both directions. This is a substantial cognitive load beyond simple function calling.
