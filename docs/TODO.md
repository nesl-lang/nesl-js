TODO 

- replace EOT_SHAM_... with EOT_... and replace END_SHAM_... with just END_...

that extra _SHAM_ is annoying and unnecessary

- rename sham to nesl

---> do this later.  this stuff should be in the config

Issues revealed by execute.md test design:

Missing gitCommit field in expected results
Context operations not tested - are they SHAM actions?
Git state check not tested - what if dirty repo?
Directory creation for file operations unclear
