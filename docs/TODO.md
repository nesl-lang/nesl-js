TODO 

- replace EOT_SHAM_... with EOT_... and replace END_SHAM_... with just END_...

that extra _SHAM_ is annoying and unnecessary

- rename sham to nesl

---> do this later.  this stuff should be in the config

----


IMPORTANT -- allow the sha-256 to be 4 characters or 3.  claude accidentally used 4 chars and it was hard to debug
