each group above contains a "search" block and a "replace" block.  format each group as strings in perl structured object format using literal non-interpolating heredocs with random custom heredocs, like this :

example


```perl
my $group0_search = <<'END_SEARCH';
search text line 1
search text line 2
END_SEARCH

my $group0_replace = <<'END_REPLACE';
replace text line 1
replace text line 2
END_REPLACE
```
