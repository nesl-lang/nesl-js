lets take a step back and make sure we're approachihng string parser correctly.whats the code that determins what string exactly should be sent to string parser?think about this in various contexts.  is string parser handing obj and array stuff too? wdytEditThe design is confused. Let's trace the data flow:
"  key = R"""pv(value)pv"""" -> [Parser] -> ??? -> [String Parser] -> "value"
What's ???? Current implementation assumes string parser gets full line. But that requires string parser to understand assignment syntax.
Alternative flows:
Option A: Parser extracts value portion
Parser: "key = R"""pv(value)pv"""" -> extract after '=' -> "R"""pv(value)pv"""" 
String Parser: "R"""pv(value)pv"""" -> "value"
Option B: String parser handles all contexts
Parser: Identifies line type (assignment/array/multiline)
String Parser: Gets full line + context type, extracts accordingly
Option C: Parser does everything
Parser: Handles strings inline, no separate string parser
Consider multiline:
ml = (
  R"""pv(line1)pv"""
  R"""pv(line2)pv"""  
)
Who tracks we're in multiline context? Who joins with \n?
Current tests assume string parser validates "no prefix/suffix" but that only makes sense if parser passes trimmed value portion. Otherwise, how does string parser know what's valid?
The fundamental question: What's the string parser's input contract?

Full line? Must understand NESL syntax.
Value portion only? Parser must pre-extract.
String literal only? Parser must locate and extract literal first.
RetrySCwe need to take a bigger step back .  walk thorugh some code examples line by line.  think about how to parse and in what stages, and how one parser can pass code to another parser (stirng parser) etc.  think slowly and incrementallyEditLet's trace through actual parsing:
nesl<<<<<<<<<nesl
{
  key = R"""pv(value)pv"""
  nested = {
    inner = R"""pv(text)pv"""
  }
  arr = [
    - R"""pv(item)pv"""
  ]
}
=========nesl
Line-by-line processing:

<<<<<<<<<nesl → Block start detected
{ → Push OBJECT state
  key = R"""pv(value)pv""" → Assignment detected

Parser sees: assignment pattern key = ...
Parser extracts key: "key"
Parser needs value after =
Question: What exactly gets passed to string parser?

Full line?   key = R"""pv(value)pv"""
After =? R"""pv(value)pv"""
Trimmed? R"""pv(value)pv"""




  nested = { → Nested object

Parser stores "nested" as key
Pushes new OBJECT state
Value is the object being built


    inner = R"""pv(text)pv""" → Same question as line 3
  arr = [ → Array start

Parser stores "arr" as key
Pushes ARRAY state


    - R"""pv(item)pv""" → Array element

Parser sees: - prefix
Question: What gets passed to string parser?

Full line?     - R"""pv(item)pv"""
After -? R"""pv(item)pv"""





Key insight: Parser must identify line type first:

Assignment → extract everything after =
Array element → extract everything after -
String literal in multiline → entire line

This suggests string parser receives only the value portion, pre-extracted by the parser based on context.RetrySCin which case it WOULD need to error out with invlaid prefix and suffix right? the string parserEditYes, exactly. If parser passes only the value portion, string parser validates the entire input is a clean string literal.
Parser extracts value portion:
"  key = R"""pv(value)pv"""" → "R"""pv(value)pv""""
"  - R"""pv(item)pv"""" → "R"""pv(item)pv""""
String parser validates entire input:
"R"""pv(value)pv"""" → success: "value"
"prefix R"""pv(value)pv"""" → error: string_not_at_value_position
"R"""pv(value)pv""" suffix" → error: content_after_string
This explains the test expectations. The string parser ensures its complete input is exactly one string literal - no prefix, no suffix.
Refactor needed:

Parser identifies line type and extracts value portion
String parser validates entire input is a string literal
Tests assume this two-stage design

Current implementation processes full lines. Should process value portions only.
