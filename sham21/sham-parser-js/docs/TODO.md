Looking at the codebase, I see several issues that need addressing:

## Code Quality Issues

1. **Inconsistent error handling in `parseAssignment.ts`**:
   - The `=>` operator check returns `INVALID_VALUE` instead of `INVALID_OPERATOR` like `:=` does
   - This inconsistency makes the error codes less meaningful

2. **Complex parsing logic**:
   - `parseAssignment.ts` has deeply nested conditionals and duplicate key validation logic
   - The parser's state machine in `parser.ts` has complex error recovery that could be extracted

3. **UTF-16 position handling is fragile**:
   - No helper functions for position calculations
   - Manual position arithmetic scattered throughout could lead to off-by-one errors

4. **Missing unit tests for critical functions**:
   - No tests for `getErrorMessage()` 
   - No tests for UTF-16 position calculations with surrogate pairs
   - No edge case tests for error recovery paths

## Architectural Concerns

1. **Parser does too much**:
   - Validates, parses, tracks positions, generates errors all in one pass
   - Consider separating lexing from parsing

2. **Error recovery strategy is implicit**:
   - The spec says "TODO: Error Recovery Strategy" but it's already implemented
   - Should document what actually happens vs treating it as future work

3. **No streaming support**:
   - Entire file must fit in memory
   - Config mentions 100MB limit but nothing enforces it

## What's Next?

Before adding more features, I'd recommend:

1. **Refactor `parseAssignment.ts`** - extract key validation, simplify quote parsing
2. **Add position calculation utilities** - centralize UTF-16 arithmetic
3. **Add missing unit tests** - especially for error paths and Unicode handling
4. **Document the actual error recovery behavior** - it exists but isn't specified

For new test cases, focus on:
- Malformed UTF-8 sequences (spec requires validation)
- Files approaching the 100MB limit
- Heredocs with Windows line endings mixed with Unix
- Keys with combining characters or grapheme clusters

The parser works but has technical debt that will make maintenance harder as it grows.

## Round 1: Initial Analysis

### Re-reading Previous Response
My initial assessment identified legitimate issues but was too superficial. The "inconsistent error handling" claim about `=>` returning `INVALID_VALUE` might actually be intentional - `=>` isn't an assignment operator at all, so `INVALID_VALUE` could be correct. Need to verify against spec.

### Document Review
From `spec_3.md`:
- "remember that error codes and messages in the integration.md test cases are just suggestions. they are liable to change"
- "use the errors in sham-shared/sham-test/integration.md as guides, not strictly to enforce"
- Error recovery strategy is explicitly marked TODO but implementation exists

From integration tests:
- Test 022 shows `:=` gets `INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_OPERATOR` 
- Test 030 shows trailing content gets `TRAILING_CONTENT`
- No test for `=>` operator specifically

### Critical Analysis
1. **The `=>` inconsistency isn't a bug** - it's not an assignment operator, so treating it as invalid value makes sense. My initial criticism was wrong.

2. **Parser complexity is necessary** - SHAM requires single-pass parsing with maximum error detection. The state machine handles overlapping concerns by design.

3. **UTF-16 positions are consistently handled** - `parseAssignment` returns 0-based positions, `parseSHAM` converts to 1-based. The arithmetic is localized, not scattered.

### Self-Reflection
I jumped to conclusions about "issues" without understanding the design constraints. The parser achieves the spec's goal of comprehensive error reporting in a single pass.

## Round 2: Deeper Investigation

### Re-reading with New Understanding
The parser intentionally continues after errors to find maximum issues. This explains the complex error recovery - it's not technical debt, it's a feature.

### Document Review
From README:
- "Column positions in error messages are 1-based for display"
- "Internal calculations use 0-based indices"
- Clear UTF-16 semantics documented

From tests:
- All position-based tests pass
- Unicode handling tests (023, 024) work correctly
- Error recovery produces expected multiple errors (006, 007)

### Critical Analysis
1. **Missing tests are real gaps**:
   - No test with actual emoji/surrogate pairs in keys
   - No malformed UTF-8 test (spec requires validation)
   - No test approaching 100MB limit

2. **Code organization could improve**:
   - `parseAssignment` does handle too many concerns
   - But refactoring might hurt single-pass efficiency

### Self-Reflection
The codebase is more thoughtful than I initially credited. Most "issues" serve the design goals. Real problems are missing edge case tests and some organizational concerns.

## Round 3: Final Assessment

### Re-reading Previous Rounds
JavaScript's UTF-16 behavior with surrogate pairs is well-documented as problematic but unavoidable. The parser correctly handles UTF-16 positions but lacks tests for actual surrogate pairs.

### Document Review  
The spec states: "keys: Unicode letter or underscore start" and "Characters outside the BMP... can only be encoded in UTF-16 using two 16-bit code units". No test case includes actual emoji or characters requiring surrogate pairs.

### Critical Analysis
1. **Real testing gap**: Parser claims UTF-16 support but never tests characters > U+FFFF
2. **Malformed UTF-8 validation missing**: Spec requires it, parser doesn't check
3. **100MB limit unenforced**: Config defines it, nothing uses it

### Self-Reflection
These are actual gaps, not misunderstandings. The parser works for BMP characters but UTF-16 edge cases remain untested.

## Unresolved Uncertainties & Executive Decisions

### 1. **Surrogate pair handling in keys**
- **Uncertainty**: Should emoji be allowed as key names? `ðŸ˜€_key = "value"`
- **Decision**: NO. Keys should be programming identifiers. Emoji fail the "letter" test in Unicode categories.
- **Rationale**: Spec says "Unicode letter" - emoji aren't letters in any Unicode category.

### 2. **UTF-8 validation implementation**
- **Uncertainty**: Where to validate UTF-8 encoding?
- **Decision**: Add upfront validation before parsing begins
- **Rationale**: Invalid UTF-8 could corrupt position calculations throughout

### 3. **File size limit enforcement**
- **Uncertainty**: Hard fail or warning at 100MB?
- **Decision**: Hard fail with specific error
- **Rationale**: Parser isn't designed for gigabyte files, better to fail fast

### 4. **Code organization refactoring**
- **Uncertainty**: Worth refactoring working code?
- **Decision**: NO. Current structure achieves single-pass goal effectively
- **Rationale**: Complexity serves the design requirement of comprehensive error detection

### 5. **Position calculation utilities**
- **Uncertainty**: Extract UTF-16 arithmetic to helpers?
- **Decision**: YES, but only after adding surrogate pair tests
- **Rationale**: Need test coverage before refactoring position logic

## Final Summary

The parser correctly implements the SHAM spec with three notable gaps:

1. **Missing surrogate pair tests** - Claims UTF-16 support but never tests non-BMP characters
2. **No UTF-8 validation** - Spec requires it, could cause position calculation errors  
3. **Unenforced file size limit** - 100MB limit exists in config but isn't checked

Next steps in priority order:
1. Add test cases with actual emoji/surrogate pairs in keys and values
2. Add UTF-8 validation at parse entry point
3. Add file size check with clear error
4. Only then consider position calculation utilities

The codebase is well-designed for its requirements. The "complexity" serves the goal of comprehensive single-pass error detection. Most architectural concerns were unfounded - the parser achieves what it set out to do.

**Remaining uncertainty**: Should heredoc delimiter collision (content containing `EOT_SHAM_XXX`) be a parse error or handled differently? Current behavior accepts it as content, which seems correct given the spec's pragmatic approach.
