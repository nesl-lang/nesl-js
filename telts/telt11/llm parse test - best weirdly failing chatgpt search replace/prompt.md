Your latest version is **excellent** — it’s clean, precise, and comprehensive. You've captured every important detail for implementing a flexible, robust TELT parser. Still, here’s a **final polish pass** after deep review, broken into three parts: **Suggested Tweaks**, **Optional Improvements**, and **What’s Perfect As-Is**.
---
## ✅ Suggested Tweaks (small, clarity-boosting)
### 1. **Clarify `--END` behavior in Syntax Overview**
Add a quick line at the end of the syntax overview that explicitly states:
> Only one `--END hash--` is used per block, regardless of the number of sections or properties.
This reinforces the rule to first-time readers.
---
### 2. **Be consistent with hash notation**
You refer to it as:
* “3-char SHA”
* “hash”
* “hash ID”
👉 Suggest standardizing to **“block hash”** throughout, and noting that it can be **1–50 characters**.
So update:
```telt
#!telt [3-char SHA: xyz]  # Block start
```
to
```telt
#!telt [block hash: xyz]  # Block start
```
And update the `HASH_DECL_START` comment:
```js
HASH_DECL_START: ' [block hash: ',
```
---
### 3. **Clarify delimiter uniqueness rule**
Where you mention:
> Works with any delimiter configuration that satisfies full-pattern uniqueness
Add one line in that bullet:
> (e.g. `--SECTION xyz--` and `--PROPERTY xyz--` are fine as long as they’re distinguishable in context)
---
## 🟨 Optional Improvements (if you want 100% coverage)
### 4. **Note on unclosed sections**
Currently, section boundaries are implicit (a new section starts or block ends). You might want to note:
> Sections are implicitly closed by the next `SECTION_START` or the block end.
This clears ambiguity for LLM or human readers.
---
### 5. **Diagnostics severity enumeration**
You use `"error" | "warning"` inline — you could optionally define them early in the doc:
> Severity levels:
>
> * `error`: prevents valid parse
> * `warning`: non-fatal issue, parse continues
---
## ✅ What’s Already Perfect
* Section/property name flexibility (`a-z`, `:`, `-`, etc.)
* Repeated property → array logic
* Multiline content treatment
* Regex patterns: safe, precise, and clearly explained
* Addendum examples: real, not contrived — shows full range of syntax
* Config validation logic: robust and well-commented
---
## 🔚 Final Verdict
You're done. This spec is:
* **Tight**: No filler, no repetition
* **Clear**: Every rule and edge case is addressed
* **Flexible**: Supports wide syntax variation safely
If you make the tiny naming tweaks and clarify `--END` behavior once more, you’re ready to ship, publish, or implement. Let me know if you'd like help generating the test suite or writing a validator.
