bad!  haiku3.5 is making up special extra end blocks like 
`--END-REPLACE-BLOCK-2 v4w--`

but we could just roll with this...

random. not happening here:

or in these:

this makes me think it must just be random for all these things... like 5 or 10% chance maybe.  not specific to minute syntax... 

and it's putting multiline vlaues for key:value stuff like it shouldnt. obviously. its confusing to me too.  overhaul.


```


#!telt [3CharHash: abc]
// write the content to the file for various purposes
=== CREATE_FILE ===
file: path/to/new.txt
--CONTENT abc--
Hello, World!
--END abc--


#!telt [3CharHash: h4t]
//here's a description of what we're doing
=== BASH ===
ls -al
--END h4t--

#!telt [3CharHash: d83]
//here's a description of what we're doing
=== BASH:5.0 ===
ls -al
--END d83--

#!telt [3CharHash: a42]
//here's a description of what we're doing
=== EXEC ===
npm install
--END a42--




#!telt [3CharHash: 83m]
=== REPLACE_IN_FILE ===
file: src/index.js
mode: overwrite
--FIND 83m--
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
--REPLACE 83m--
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
--END 83m--

```

check out the above new syntax language.  generate some more examples for it. dont use an artifact
