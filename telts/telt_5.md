haiku still confused.  puts ID in all the right places, but not using the actualy 3charhash... https://claude.ai/chat/24095784-e353-459d-829a-98290d823f43

this === feels more sensible to me tho.  i was getting confused using same syntax for all parts


```


#!telt 3CharHash: abc
// write the content to the file for various purposes
=== CREATE_FILE ===
file: path/to/new.txt
--CONTENT abc--
Hello, World!
--END abc--


#!telt 3CharHash: h4t
//here's a description of what we're doing
=== BASH ===
ls -al
--END h4t--

#!telt 3CharHash: d83
//here's a description of what we're doing
=== BASH:5.0 ===
ls -al
--END d83--

#!telt 3CharHash: a42
//here's a description of what we're doing
=== EXEC ===
npm install
--END a42--




#!telt 3CharHash: 83m
=== REPLACE_IN_FILE ===
file: src/index.js
mode: overwrite
--FIND 83m--
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
--REPLACE 83m--
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
--END 83m--

```

check out the above new syntax language.  generate some more examples for it. dont use an artifact
