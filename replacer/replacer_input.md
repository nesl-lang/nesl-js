SUCCESS Block 1: Updated /Users/stuart/repos/nesl-lang/nesl-js/sham-shared/config.json
===

I see the issue! The config.json has a hardcoded regex pattern `"^[A-Za-z0-9]{3}$"` that only matches exactly 3 characters, but it should be using the `blockIdMinLength` and `blockIdMaxLength` values (3 and 8) to create a pattern that matches 3-8 characters.

We need to fix the config.json file:

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Update the blockId pattern in config.json to use the range {3,8} instead of exactly {3} to match the blockIdMinLength and blockIdMaxLength values

<<<FILE>>>
/Users/stuart/repos/nesl-lang/nesl-js/sham-shared/config.json

<<<SEARCH>>>
    "blockId": "^[A-Za-z0-9]{3}$",
<<<REPLACE>>>
    "blockId": "^[A-Za-z0-9]{3,8}$",
<<<END>>>

After this change, you'll need to regenerate the patterns.ts file by running:
```bash
node scripts/generate-patterns.js
```

This will update the generated `src/patterns.ts` file with the correct regex pattern that matches 3-8 character block IDs.
